      <h1>The Walk of Growth</h1>
      <p class="major">
        Born in Austria in the mid 80s, I was a happy child. Through circumstances and life choices I started distancing myself.
        By the time I was 5 years old I spent the majority of my time alone in my room - my safe zone.

        Come with me on this adventure of personal growth.

			<h2>The Safe Zone</h2>

      <p>
        Spending the majority of my time in my room meant I would only be coming
        out for school and to go food hunting. Nights became my favorites.
        Nobody was awake to stop me from seeking pleasure in eating junk food.
        Gradually I managed to eat my way up to over 300 lbs.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a vicious circle. I ate in order to suppress my feelings, but the
        more I ate the worse I felt. At school I would see other kids climbing
        ropes, later at night in bed I would pray for the miracle of becoming
        lean. All I wanted was a strong body so I could climb those ropes with
        my bare hand. Phantasies about me showing off in school was what I fell
        asleep to. Having a hard time making friends and staying connected, I
        turned to TV and became even more sedentary.

      <h2>Adaptation</h2>

      <p>
        During that time I also developed a passion for computers. The internet
        allowed me to research and learn what I needed. By the time I was 17 I
        dropped out of school and started to work for the local government. I
        jumped between multiple jobs never staying longer than 9 months. All
        the TV shows and movies I saw made me obsessed with coming to the US.
        So finally in 2010 I got a tourist visa and went to Los Angeles for 3
        months.

      <h2>The Journey</h2>

      <p>
        My time in Los Angeles was inspiring to say the least. When I went back
        to Austria I had one mission - finding a way to get back to the US.
        While on the Austrian autobahn I get a call about a job at Salesforce.
        This started me on a journey of personal growth I still can't fully
        grasp. The first year and a half I worked my ass off with the single
        goal of getting transferred to the US. I started volunteering and
        making great connections. Still I was angry, angry with the world.

      <h2>Growth Spurt</h2>

      <p>
        Having reached my dream and being in San Francisco made me think about
        myself. Progressively I stopped thinking of myself as the victim and
        took back authority of my life, my choices, my thoughts. Within two
        years I lost 100 pounds and can't even describe the development I've
        made with my mind. I got support to figure out my core values. Got
        introduced to meditation and mindfulness. Had people teach me the
        difference between mobility and flexibility. And slowly started building
        real connections.

      <h2>Afternoon Walk</h2>

      <p>
        A sunny Sunday afternoon in San Francisco inspired me to go for a walk.
        I started out at my apartment and heading north towards the Marina
        district and one and a half hours later I was standing at Golden Gate
        bridge. At that point I was still in good shape so I decided to trek
        through the Presidio to Golden Gate park and from there I went back to
        my apartment. A good 12 miles in a little more than three hours. Walking
        a pace of almost 4 miles an hour made me proud of what I had
        accomplished. Over the next few days I shared my accomplishment with my
        friends and while talking about it I realized that I had walked just
        short of a half marathon.

      <h2>First Challenge</h2>

      <p>
        As I fully understood what that meant, my next goal was set. I had to
        walk at least 13 miles and because I'm a notorious overachiever I set my
        sight on a 20 mile hike through the Marin Headlands. More than two
        months later I finally started on the hike. This time I went up to
        Golden Gate Park, about half way through I made a right turn north
        towards the Presidio. While walking I made sure to keep Snapchat updated
        on my milestones. And I was fast - after not even two hours and 6.5
        miles I reached Golden Gate Bridge, my second milestone, averaging
        almost 4 miles per hour. After 11 miles and descending Hawk Hill I took
        my first break.

      <h2>The Limits</h2>

      <p>
        Cell service got progressively poorer north of the bridge but luckily I
        had put the trail on my watch. Never the less I lost my way in the
        headlands for half an hour. Every step started to wear on me. While the
        sun started to set, my mind grew more worried and I remember thinking
        about how I could defend myself against bobcats. Funny enough I was
        walking on “Bobcat Trail” at that time and I didn't even know. Just
        before the last bit of daylight faded away I made it to the top and
        started hiking down “Morning Sun Trail” towards Sausalito. Walking down
        was starting to be painful. My core muscles started flaring up and every
        step felt like a knife getting torn out of my lower abs. I barely made
        it on to the ferry but couldn't get myself to walk back the 1.6 miles
        to my apartment.

      <h2>Decision &amp; Doubt</h2>

      <p>
        The next day I stayed in bed - any movement made me painfully remember
        the prior day. But I also was flying on cloud nine, 18 miles in 5 hours
        or 3.6 miles per hour moving average. Walking for the next two weeks was
        arguably difficult, blisters formed on both of my feet and the blister
        patches didn't help a bit. Still I thought if I could do 18 miles, I
        might be able to do more. So I started researching hiking trails and
        found the Appalachian Trail. 2,160 miles from Georgia to Maine. That was
        going to be my ultimate feat. It didn't take me long to get excited and
        even less time to start talking to my friends about it. One night in a
        bar while talking about it again, a friend brought up the Pacific Crest
        Trail and the book “Wild” he read a while ago. This of course prompted
        me to do some research and not only is the PCT closer to San Francisco,
        it's also a whopping 500 miles longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        While my excitement about walking the trail rose I knew I had to pace
        myself. My Green Card process was still not through and that was the
        singular most important thing to me in the last 5 years. The whole
        reason I started working for Salesforce in the first place was to get
        transferred to the US and get my Green Card. So I made myself the
        promise to walk the PCT in 2017 if I get my Green Card in time.

      <h2>Approval</h2>

      <p>
        Just before Christmas I packed my bags and left for Austria like every
        year. And like every year we had Christmas at my moms on the 24th, went
        to the spa on the 25th and the family lunch on the 26th. After lunch I
        got invited to my cousins for coffee and of course I shared my plans of
        hiking the PCT. While talking to my cousin Benni that afternoon as well
        as on New Years Eve, he got so excited for me about the hike. All the
        love I received from my family and friends during those three weeks made
        one thing clear to me, it doesn't matter if I get a Green Card or not -
        everything happens for a reason. That's when I decided I wasn't going to
        let anything keep me from living my life to the fullest.
